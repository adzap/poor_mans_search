= Poor Man's Search Rails Plugin

Home: http://github.com/adzap/poor_mans_search (original links are dead)

<tt>poor_mans_search</tt> is a mixin for ActiveRecord that provides basic searching on model records utilzing
sql search querying.  This mixin merely provides automated building of SQL search queries, it is up to you
to ensure that the queried columns are properly indexed and/or have the appropriate support on your database.

For database independent search functionality, please see acts_as_ferret and acts_as_searchable, among others.  Also, please make a conscious decision that db text searching is what you really want - read this blog entry
for a good db vs. ferret comparison:

The core of this plugin is based on the <tt>find_by_keyword</tt> functionality originally conceived by
Gleb Arshinov (http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/FullTextSearch) and reproduced here: http://www.rorpaste.com/paste/details/583

== Installation

Install this plugin to your rails project with:

<tt>script/plugin install git://github.com/adzap/poor_mans_search.git</tt>

== Usage

Include the <tt>poor_mans_search_on</tt> declaration within any model class that you wish to be searchable.  For
instance, assume a <tt>Post</tt> model:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
	  poor_mans_search_on :title, :body
	end
	
This gives you the <tt>search_for</tt> class method on <tt>Post</tt> that takes a list of search terms and
any other standard find options:

	# Get the first 20 posts within the last year that contain the word <tt>test</tt>
	#
	# Equivalent to the following query:
	#
	#   SELECT * FROM posts WHERE
	#     ((published_at > '2006-08-02 14:29:17') AND
	#      (lower(posts.title) like '%test%' OR lower(posts.body) like '%test%'))
	#     ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 20
	#
  Post.search_for('TEst', :conditions => ["published_at > ?", (Time.now - 1.year)],
													:limit => 20, :order => 'published_at DESC')
